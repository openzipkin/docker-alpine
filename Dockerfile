# alpine_version is hard-coded here to allow the following to work:
#  * `docker build https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-alpine.git`
#
# When updating, update the README and the alpine_version ARG
#  * Use current version from https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/
#  * ARGs repeat because Dockerfile ARGs are layer specific but will reuse the value defined here.
